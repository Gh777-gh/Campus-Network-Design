# Campus-Network-Design
Designed and simulated a university campus network demonstrating routing, switching, VLANs, subnetting, and network segmentation as part of a Computer Networks course.
# Campus Network Design – Aljamoum Female Campus

## Overview
This project focuses on designing a complete campus network for Aljamoum Female Campus using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network connects multiple departments across two buildings while ensuring scalability, organization, and efficient communication.

## Campus Requirements
- Two interconnected buildings
- Building 1 departments:
  - Computer Science
  - Mathematics
  - Finance
- Building 2 departments:
  - Biology
  - Chemistry
  - Physics
- Each department includes teaching staff and administrative offices
- Dedicated computer labs for the Computer Science department
- Administrative offices including dean and vice dean offices

## Network Design Approach
- Designed a hierarchical network topology to connect all buildings and departments
- Applied IP addressing and subnetting for logical network segmentation
- Used routers and switches to manage traffic efficiently
- Ensured scalability for future expansion

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Deliverables
- Complete network topology design
- Configuration screenshots
- Packet Tracer project file

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience in campus network planning
- Improved understanding of subnetting and IP addressing
- Hands-on practice with routing and switching concepts
